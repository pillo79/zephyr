  Texas Instruments BQ25120A Low IQ Highly Integrated
  Battery Charge Management Solution for Wearables and IoT

  This PMIC has one buck converter and one LDO converter. Both need to be
  defined as children nodes, strictly following the BUCK and LDO node
  names. For example:

  pmic@46 {
    compatible = "ti,bq25120a";
    reg = <0x46>;
    ...
    regulators {
      compatible = "ti,bq25120a-regulator";

      BUCK {
        /* all properties for BUCK */
      };
      LDO {
        /* all properties for LDO */
      };
    };
  };

compatible: "ti,bq25120a-regulator"
